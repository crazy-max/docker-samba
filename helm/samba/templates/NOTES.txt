Congratulations! Your Samba server has been successfully deployed.

To access your Samba server, use the following information:

Service Name: {{ .Release.Name }}-{{ .Chart.Name }}
Namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}

By default, the Samba server listens on the following ports:
- SMB: 445
- NetBIOS: 137, 138, 139

You can mount the shares with an SMB client as follows:

smbclient -L //{{ .Release.Name }}-samba.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local -U <username>

Replace `<username>` with the actual user name.
